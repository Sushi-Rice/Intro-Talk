Okay guys, Cubic here.
First of all, welcome to the server. Since anyone see read what are saying, please refrain from using each other's in real life name. Thanks!
Second, I have no idea how to code. That'll soon change if I keep active on here, I guess.
Third, put your ideas for what we should do this little project on either Hangouts or here.
Enough rules, let's have a blast on here! Cubic out as of 19 Feburary 2017.
